# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

This Node.js command-line application allows users to generate a simple logo and save it as an SVG file. The user can specify the text (up to three characters), text color, shape (circle, triangle, square), and shape color. The application will then create and save an SVG file named `logo.svg` based on the user's input.
